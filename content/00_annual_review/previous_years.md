## 2017-2018: Part-Time

### Work

- Looked into evolutionary algorithms for finding models on the Pareto frontier of the utility / fairness trade­off
- Worked on adversarial approach to fairness with Alexey Umnov
- Implemented changes to AlgoFairness framework so that it meets PAL needs
- Worked on a paper with NQ and VS
- Working on EthicML python framework

### Activity within the group

- Regular presentations (and attendance) within PAL reading group. Talks given:­
  - Iterative Machine Teaching
  - Fair and Transferable Representations
  - The Delayed Impact of Fair Machine Learning
  - Path­Specific Counterfactual Fairness
- Teaching Topics in Computing: Ethical ML

## 2018-2019: Full-Time

### Work

- CVPR paper on discovering fair representations in the data domain.
- IJCAI submission on using generative models to balance a dataset with regard to
  sensitive groups and their outcomes.
- NeurIPS submission on censoring a representation using an invertible network.
- Written EthicML python library for measuring fairness (`pip install EthicML`).
- Taught several lectures on FairML.
