# Fair Representations of Biased Data
Thank you for looking at this work-in-progress document.

The purpose of this format is that work used in the annual review can be easily extended into a thesis.
This format has been selected so that runnable code examples can be used to express a point (if appropriate). 

If on any page there are questions you'd like to raise, please raise an issue using the github icon at the top of each page.
Similarly, if there are any minor suggestions, you can use that tool as well.
