<span id="intro"></span><h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This literature review aims to give a summary of research to date in the area of <em>Ethical Machine Learning</em>.
This is a broad topic which includes fairness, interpretability and ultimately, accountability in automated decision making.
Whilst this is a relatively new area of research, there is a growing body of work, which is highlighted at conferences such as
FAT/ML (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in Machine Learning)
as well as dedicated tracks at prestigious conferences such as NIPS
<span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id9">Barocas and Hardt, 2017</a>]</span> and ICML <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id32">Corbett-Davies and Goel, 2018</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The reason for this increase in activity is simple.
Machine Learning models reflect underlying data.
This has enabled them to be incredibly successful, performing to a superhuman standard for many tasks
<span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id160">Vincent, 2017</a>]</span>.
Typically these tend to be objective problems such as predicting the weather
<span id="id4">[]</span>, playing Atari games <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id2">Adamski <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>]</span> or distinguishing between plant phenotypes
<span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id150">Singh <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>]</span>.
In fact, the success and high performance of machine
learning techniques in these areas has led to the desire to apply these
same techniques to more subjective areas, such as advertising
<span id="id7">[]</span>, parole hearings
<span id="id8">[]</span> or CV screening <span id="id9">[]</span>.
However, this presents a problem, described in the paper “Residual Unfairness in Fair
Machine Learning from Prejudiced Data” <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id87">Kallus and Zhou, 2018</a>]</span> as
“Bias In, Bias Out”.
This refers to training a model on biased data and (unwittingly) approximating a biased function.
It is analogous to the database mantra “Garbage In, Garbage Out”.
In principle, this short description is appealing, but it leaves us with hard questions to face,
such as defining bias in this context and how to rectify it.
In <a class="reference internal" href="#definitions"><span class="std std-ref">Definitions of Discrimination &amp; Fairness</span></a>, we’ll review the current trends in bias definitions and give some firmer
definitions of the counterbalance, fairness, with regard to unfairness in data.
This is followed by <a class="reference internal" href="#impl"><span class="std std-ref">Implementing</span></a>, an overview of how fairness constraints are being added to existing models.</p>
<p>The predominant discussion in this review is around fairness, as this has received the most attention within the machine
learning community.
The other areas, interpretability and accountability, which comprise the greater ‘ethical’ category have received far
less attention<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id279" id="id11">1</a>.
Although, we’ll discuss them briefly in the related work section <a class="reference internal" href="#background"><span class="std std-ref">Initial Experiments in Fairness and Related Work</span></a>.</p>
<p>One area that has received little exploration, is the difference between
transparency and interpretability. These terms are often used as
synonyms, however that leads to confusion. A system can be transparent,
but that doesn’t mean we are capable of interpreting the results<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id280" id="id12">2</a>.
Similar to the idea of a transparent system is one where we can see an
intermediate representation. This is the concept of learned “fair”
representations which have proved to be a popular approach to remove
bias from the feature space. However, whilst transparent (to a degree),
the lack of interpretability may ultimately become their downfall. An
overview of learned representations and more of this discussion is in <a class="reference internal" href="#impl-repr"><span class="std std-ref">Fair Representations</span></a>.</p>
<p>An over-arching theme throughout this review is that these problems are
not just complicated, they are complex. There’s a major challenge that a
lot of biases are ingrained into our culture. An example of this is the
everyday words that we use as highlighted by the paper “Man is to
Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings”
<span id="id13">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id16">Bolukbasi <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>]</span>. The exercise of debiasing word embeddings
is appealing, and has sparked debate, with recent papers “Mitigating
Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning”
<span id="id14">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id177">Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>]</span> and “Adversarial Removal of Demographic
Attributes from Text Data” <span id="id15">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id45">Elazar and Goldberg, 2018</a>]</span> proposing techniques
based on adversarial learning and a warning against this approach
respectively. The adversarial approach to combating this problem is
discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="#impl-adv"><span class="std std-ref">Adversarial Learning</span></a>.</p>
<p>As these problems are complex, simply analysing correlations may not be
enough to solve them without understanding the causal relationship
between attributes. A predominant issue in this area revolves around the
problem that what is considered discriminatory is domain-specific,
requiring subject matter expertise to identify. For example, sex may be
an important, non-discriminatory feature in a diagnosis system, but
would be considered discriminatory by a bank to determine if you should
receive a loan. Due to this, causal inference as a method to understand
relationships between attributes is gaining in popularity. A brief
summation of this activity is covered in <a class="reference internal" href="#causal"><span class="std std-ref">Causal Inference</span></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the predominant body of fairness literature is
based around classification, though this needn’t be the case. There are
a small number of papers that apply fairness criteria to other tasks,
such as reinforcement learning, recommendations and resource allocation.
A brief overview of some of this work is given in <a class="reference internal" href="#other"><span class="std std-ref">Other Areas</span></a> before the future
works and conclusion sections of this review.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-are-we-doing-this">
<h3>Why are we doing this?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-we-doing-this" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The area of bias and discrimination isn’t a new one. Legal scholars have
been writing about this problem for decades. As such, there are a number
of regulations around the world that make it illegal to discriminate. In
the UK discrimination based on age, disability, gender reassignment,
marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion
or belief, sex and sexual orientation are all covered by the Equality
Act 2010, let alone other protections within specific domains. As such,
the problem about automated bias has been highlighted by researchers for
a number of years and institutions are starting to pay attention.
Governments around the world are saying that this is an issue. Both the
House of Lords <span id="id16">[]</span> and the Whitehouse
<span id="id17">[]</span> say that this issue should be addressed.
Propublica’s ‘Machine Bias’ <span id="id18">[]</span> article
sparked debate and raised concerns that needed to be addressed by the
community after demonstrating that (at least on the surface) recidivism
prediction software produced by Northpointe advised that black people in
the U.S. were more likely to re-offend than similar profile offenders
who were white.</p>
<p>The aim is to approach justifiable concerns head on. Doing this has a
number of benefits. It’s changing the questions that we’re asking about
fairness, bias and the impact they have on our own societies, and also
prompting researchers to find innovative ways of adapting models to
complex real-world problems.</p>

<h3>Fairness<a class="headerlink" href="#fairness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned, the predominant body of literature with regard to fairness
is based around classification, which is an inherently discriminative
task. This is in the Latin sense that we are trying to discriminate
between two (or more) classes. However, in <em>fair classification</em> we aim
to reduce discrimination referring to unfair treatment of a person, or a
group of people based on membership of a category, with no regard to
individual merit. This is an important distinction and was first raised
in the now seminal 2008 paper “Discrimination Aware Data Mining”
<span id="id19">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id130">Pedreshi <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>]</span>. The membership of the
category that we are conscious of not discriminating against is referred
to as a <em>potentially discriminatory</em> attribute. This paper argues that
this is different to being a <em>sensitive attribute</em> giving the example
that gender is not often considered sensitive, but it can be
discriminatory. In general, later work has adopted that both sensitive
attributes and potentially discriminatory attributes are both referred
to as sensitive attributes, though more recent works, such as
“Path-Specific Counterfactual
Fairness”<span id="id20">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id26">Chiappa, 2019</a>]</span><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id281" id="id21">3</a> go back to this
original view that they are different. The predominant take-away from
this paper is that it is simply not enough to not directly capture a
sensitive attribute. The reason for this is that a sensitive attribute
can be effectively ‘reconstructed’ from the other features. In the paper
they give the example of determining whether to give a loan to an
applicant or not. They point out that if we decide not to capture the
race of an applicant, but still capture area code, we could potentially
learn the rule “rarely give credit to applicants in neighbourhood 10451
from NYC”. This may seem harmless, but if you asked a subject matter
expert who advised that the vast majority of people in NYC area 10451
were black, then the learned rule is equivalent to “rarely give credit
to black-race applicants in neighbourhood 10451 in NYC”, which is
evidently discriminatory <span id="id22">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id130">Pedreshi <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>]</span>. The
paper is set in the field of data-mining and the aim is to find rules
that discriminate in some way. The authors distinguish between direct
discrimination, which uses a sensitive attribute directly, and indirect
discrimination which uses a non-sensitive feature (or combination of
features) as a proxy for the sensitive feature and then use this proxy
in the rule.</p>
<p>Independently, Kamiran and Calders <span id="id23">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id89">Kamiran and Calders, 2009</a>]</span> started investigating
fairness with regards to classification. Their approach hinges around
the notion that the bias isn’t captured in the features of an
individual, but within the label <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>. Their approach involves measuring
the discrimination that an individual receives (defined in the following
section) and ranking the data-points based on this with the aim of
finding the unbiased label <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y'\)</span> and pre-processing the data to reflect
this. They then ‘switch’ the label for data that they believe was
discriminated against, on the condition that for every data point you
‘switch’, you ‘switch’ a data-point of the opposite class which you also
believe to have been discriminated against. The notion that bias exists
within the label is an interesting one and reflects our understanding of
the world. Intuitively, there is no bias in just having an attribute,
such as race, the bias only exists in outcomes based on that feature.
This assumption has now been challenged. It’s been observed that due to
the inherent feedback loop of decisions regarding people, that decisions
that affect a generation have repercussions. If a group are perpetually
discriminated against, then over time the sensitive attribute is
reflected in other features.</p>
<p>The other areas of ethical research, accountability and
interpretability, have received far less attention, though now we give a
brief overview.</p>

<div class="section" id="interpretability">
<h3>Interpretability<a class="headerlink" href="#interpretability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Interpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause
of a decision. Some models are inherently interpretable, such as
Decision Trees, or to a lesser extent linear models. There are also
model agnostic interpretability techniques such as local surrogate
models such as “Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)”
<span id="id29">[]</span>, or game-theory approaches to explanation
such as the Shapley Value <span id="id30">[]</span>.</p>
<p>From “Explanation in Artificial Intelligence : Insights from the Social
Sciences” <span id="id31">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id120">Miller, 2019</a>]</span>, Interpretability is the degree
to which a human can understand the cause of a decision. The book
“Interpretable Machine Learning” <span id="id32">[]</span> frames that statement in a
slightly different way, describing interpretability is “the degree to
which a human can consistently predict the model’s result”. In this
review we have already distinguished between transparency and
interpretability, but <span id="id33">[]</span> distinguishes further between
interpretability and explanation. Miller <span id="id34">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id120">Miller, 2019</a>]</span>
argues that even if we are capable of interpreting the results of a
model, unless we receive an explanation of how that model came to make a
decision, then we will be unable to reliably reproduce the results. not
only that, but as humans, any old explanation will not do, we require a
<em>good explanation</em>. According to Miller <span id="id35">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id120">Miller, 2019</a>]</span>,
good explanations are:-</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>contrastive</strong>. We tend to think in a counterfactual way i.e. would
I have been approved for a loan if I earned more money. Explanations
should reflect this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>selected</strong>. The world is complex and we don’t like to receive too
much information. As such, we should only give 1 to 3 explanations
that cover the majority of cases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>social</strong>. They should be tailored to your audience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>focused on the abnormal</strong>. If a data-point contains an anomaly
that impacts the result, use that in the explanation. i.e. house
price being predicted unusually highly as the property contains 5
balconies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>truthful</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>coherent with prior beliefs of the explainee</strong></p></li>

<div class="section" id="definitions-of-discrimination-fairness">
<span id="definitions"></span><h2>Definitions of Discrimination &amp; Fairness<a class="headerlink" href="#definitions-of-discrimination-fairness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Discrimination and fairness are not the same thing. One is the problem,
and the other is the remedy. Because of this, typically we describe
measures of discrimination and fairness constraints, which are used to
combat discrimination.</p>
<p>Legal scholars have defined that discrimination can occur in two forms,
Disparate Treatment and Disparate Impact. <em>Disparate Treatment</em> is
making a decision (directly, or indirectly) due to a protected
characteristic, and <em>Disparate Impact</em> is the result of a seemingly fair
decision affecting a protected group unfairly. Essentially, disparate
treatment is in the measuring of the effect of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{y}\)</span>.
Disparate impact is found in measuring the difference between
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p(\hat{y}|s=0)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p(\hat{y}|s=1)\)</span><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id282" id="id36">4</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly these definitions are not mutually exclusive. You could choose a
decision rule that treated groups disparately and it may or may not show
disparate impact. Similarly regardless of whether there is disparate
treatment, there can still be disparate impact. Splitting measures of
discrimination between these two groups then is a moot point, as most
measures will fall into both definitions. However, examples of
discrimination measures are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Difference in mean scores
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{E}(\hat{Y}|S=0) = \mathbb{E}(\hat{Y}|S=1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Difference in average residuals
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{E}(\hat{Y}-Y|S=0) = \mathbb{E}(\hat{Y}-Y|S=1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Equal Opportunity (discussed later in this section)
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\hat{Y} | S=0, Y=1) - P(\hat{Y} | S=1, Y=1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Demographic Parity Measure (discussed later in this section)
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\hat{Y} | S=0) - P(\hat{Y} | S=1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Normalised Mutual Information score<br />
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{H(\hat{Y})H(S)}} \sum_{\hat{y} \in \hat{Y}, s \in S} P(\hat{y},s)\log \frac{P(\hat{y},s)}{P(\hat{y})P(s)}\)</span>
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H(Y) = - \sum_{y \in Y}P(y) \log P(y)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="types-of-fairness">
<h3>Types of Fairness<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-fairness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fairness constraints on the other hand have three forms. In the
currently unfinished book on Fairness in Machine Learning
<span id="id37">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id10">Barocas <em>et al.</em>, 2019</a>]</span> the definitions of fairness are described as
belonging to one of three groups, <em>Independence</em>, <em>Separation</em> or
<em>Sufficiency</em>. This pattern is adopted in this section.</p>
<div class="section" id="independence">
<h4>Independence<a class="headerlink" href="#independence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The most intuitive notion of fairness is <em>Independence</em>. This is the
notion that given a prediction (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{Y}\)</span>) and a protected sensitive
attribute (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>), then the prediction should be independent of the
sensitive attribute</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(\hat{Y}) \perp S\]</div>
<p>In fact, one of the first
papers in this area by Kamiran and Calders <span id="id38">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id89">Kamiran and Calders, 2009</a>]</span> use this as

<p>Statistical Parity (or
Demographic Parity as it often known) appeals to an intuitive sense of
group fairness, namely that the outcome of the model should be
independent of some sensitive attribute(s). For example, the probability
of you being accepted at university should be the same if you are male
as if you are female (and vice-versa).</p>
<p>There are situations however, where this doesn’t work as intended. In
these cases, instead of promoting the perceived harmed group based on
the quality of the individual, as long as the probability of acceptance
is the same, the criteria is met.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let’s consider an example that will be used across
all our definitions. Imagine that we are in charge of admissions at a
university and we are particularly concerned with complying to a
fairness criteria with regard to male and female subgroups. At this
university we can only accept 50% of all applicants. To determine if you
are likely to succeed there is an entrance criteria, which is highly
predictive of success. In fact, 80% of people who meet the entry
criteria successfully graduate. However, many students apply despite not
meeting the criteria. Universally, only 10% of students successfully
graduate if they do not meet the entrance criteria. Both male and female
subgroups apply to our university in equal numbers, though only 40% of
applying males meet the entrance criteria, whilst 60% of applying
females meet the entrance criteria. As already stated, we can only
accept 50% of applicants to be students. Under Demographic Parity, we
would require that 50% of both males and females be accepted, regardless
of likely academic performance. So even though only 40% of male
applicants meet the qualifying academic criteria, an additional 10% of
the population would have to be accepted at random to be ‘fair’, whilst
10% of qualified females would be rejected.</p>
<p>To counter this, yet keeping within the frame of <em>independence</em>,
relaxations of this criterion have also been suggested to include parity
up to some threshold, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span>. <span id="id41">[]</span></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(\hat{Y}|s=a) \geq P(\hat{Y}|s=b) - \epsilon\]</div>
<p>or via a ratio</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{P(\hat{Y}|s=a)}{P(\hat{Y}|s=b)} \geq 1 - \epsilon\]</div>
<p>When set to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon = 0.2\)</span>, this is seen as comparable to the <em>80%
rule</em> mentioned in disparate impact law <span id="id42">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id49">Feldman <em>et al.</em>, 2015</a>]</span>.
This rule suggests that as long as the selection rate of the ‘harmed’
group is within 80% of the ‘privileged’ group, then it is fair enough.
Though critics of this point out that 80% was chosen arbitrarily.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="separation">
<h4>Separation<a class="headerlink" href="#separation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A more complex definition of fairness is <em>separation</em>, which is
independence given the actual outcome (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y\)</span>) $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{Y} \perp S | Y\)</span>$</p>
<p>This has been formalised by the metric Equalised Odds <span id="id43">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id68">Hardt <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>]</span> which
considers all values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y\)</span>, and the looser constraint Equality of
Opportunity <span id="id44">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id68">Hardt <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>]</span>, which only constrains independence given the
outcome is positive .</p>
<p>Equalised Odds</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{align*}
    P(\hat{Y}|s=0, y=0) &amp;= P(\hat{Y}|s=1, y=0) \\
    \&amp; \\
    P(\hat{Y}|s=0, y=1) &amp;= P(\hat{Y}|s=1, y=1)    
\end{align*}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Equality of Opportunity $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\hat{Y}|s=0, y=1) = P(\hat{Y}|s=1, y=1)\)</span>$</p>
<p>Essentially, Equalised Odds ensure matching true positive rate (TPR) and
false positive rate (FPR) across the sensitive groups, whereas Equality
of Opportunity only ensures that the TPR of both (all) sensitive groups
are equal. The benefit of this is that it is a truer representation of
fairness.</p>
<p>In our university admission example, Equality of Opportunity is
equivalent to accepting members of both female and male subgroups at
different rates, as long as the true positive rate of both groups is
equal. So we would be looking to accept <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(44.5\%\)</span> of males and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(55.5\%\)</span>
of females, which would give both groups a TPR of 85.4%.</p>
<p>If we were enforcing Equalised Odds, we would have to make sure that we
were not only matching the true positive rate, but also the false
positive rate. In our example, the selection rate would be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(46.4\%\)</span> for
males and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(53.6\%\)</span> for females.</p>
<p>But could an algorithm satisfy both independence and separation?
Unfortunately not, it is shown in <span id="id45">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id68">Hardt <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>]</span> that independence based
notions of fairness are incompatible with separation based notions of
fairness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sufficiency">
<h4>Sufficiency<a class="headerlink" href="#sufficiency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>There is a less well utilised general area of fairness criteria called
<em>sufficiency</em>. This is the concept that the true outcome, given the
predicted score is independent of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span>.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Y \perp S | \hat{Y}\]</div>
<p>In our example, we would leave the selection rates alone, giving a
selection rate of 40% for the male subgroup and 60% for the female
subgroup as then we treat applicants equally based our anticipation of
their success.</p>
<p>Similarly to the conflict between independence and separation, there is
a conflict between independence and sufficiency, and between separation
and sufficiency. These conflicts can be described succinctly, so we
demonstrate them below.</p>
<p>To show that sufficiency and independence are mutually exclusive, let’s
assume that there exists data where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y\)</span> is dependent on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>.
Independence is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{Y} \perp S\)</span>, sufficiency is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y \perp S | \hat{Y}\)</span>.
By simply claiming both of these statements to be true, we then have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
S \perp \hat{Y} \textbf{ and } S \perp Y | \hat{Y} 
\Rightarrow S \perp Y
\]</div>
<p>This shows that independence and sufficiency can only hold when we
contradict our assumption.</p>
<p>Similarly, for separation and sufficiency if we assume that again we
have data where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y \not \perp S\)</span> we can show that for both to hold we
would have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
S \perp \hat{Y} | Y \textbf{ and } S \perp Y | \hat{Y}
\Rightarrow S \perp Y
\]</div>
<p>which again is contradictory to our assumption, demonstrating that we
can’t have both sufficiency and separation based notions of fairness
unless the data is inherently unbiased. This notion of trade-offs and
balancing tension is a common one throughout fair machine learning, and
certainly one that we will come back to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="balancing-the-types">
<h4>Balancing the Types<a class="headerlink" href="#balancing-the-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The above is a useful framework for viewing fairness constraints and
helps us to categorise various definitions of fairness, such as those in
table 1, but that shouldn’t diminish work that seeks to make novel
strides within each of the areas. For example, the work in “An
Intersectional Definition of Fairness”
<span id="id46">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id51">Foulds <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a>]</span> expands the independence notion of
fairness. Their inspiration comes from third-wave feminism and
intersectional privacy, and is trying to expand beyond binary sensitive
groups and measuring an unfairness value at each intersect. For example,
consider we have a dataset with three sensitive attributes, sex, race
and religion. Most approaches to date consider these to be one feature
<em>sex_race_religion</em>. This paper measures the difference with respect
to demographic parity between each combination of sensitive attributes
so that sex, race and religion are all viewed as separate, measurable
points of potential discrimination, being concerned with whether
discrimination occurs in any, some, or if only with all attributes
present.</p>

<p>Which fairness definition (or family of definitions) should one be
using? This is a more complex question to answer. Some, such as
<span id="id47">[]</span> make the assumption the the choice of which
to apply should come from the designer’s moral perspective, arguing that
this is a task outside of the expertise of computer scientists and
instead should be debated by philosophers.</p>
<p>However, not everyone is agreed. Recently there has started to be work
investigating the delayed impact that fair interventions in machine
learning have on society <span id="id48">[]</span>. This work looks to determine the
impact that different notions of fairness have on the groups involved,
recognising that there is more than the initial ‘accepted for a loan’ or
‘rejected for a loan’ dichotomy, but that this has an impact in terms of
credit score for the individual applying. This is a bold approach that
tries to measure the effect that automated decisions may have 1
generation into the future. Although not explicitly stated, it leaves
the suggestion that maybe we should be using statistical models to
underpin moral assumptions.</p>
<p>A recent paper “Evaluating Fairness Metrics in the Presence of Dataset
Bias” <span id="id49">[]</span> looked into the problem of
determining which fairness criteria to apply. They look at a dataset<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id283" id="id50">5</a>
which they use to create 4 datasets, with combinations of Sample Bias,
No Sample Bias, Label Bias and No Label Bias. They consider a binary
race attribute (Black, White) where White race is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=0\)</span> and Black race
is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=1\)</span>. Label Bias is where there are different label thresholds based
on race, in this case</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
\hat{Y} = 
\begin{cases}
1 \text{ if score} \geq 0.3, \text{else } 0 &amp; \text{if race = white} \\
1 \text{ if score} \geq 0.7, \text{else } 0 &amp; \text{if race = black}
\end{cases}

<p>Sample Bias is where one group (in this case White race) has people
selected at a higher rate, in this case</p>

1   &amp; \text{if race = black}

up all discrimination and that all fairness metrics require “a healthy

<h3>Similarity Measures<a class="headerlink" href="#similarity-measures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All definitions of fairness that we’ve looked at so far consider
proportions of groups, called <em>group fairness</em>. There is another
approach, called <em>individual fairness</em>. This is the idea that regardless
of any groups as a whole, similar individuals should be treated
similarly. This idea was proposed by Luong et al.
<span id="id51">[]</span> in the context of k-NN and later refined by
Dwork et al. <span id="id52">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id42">Dwork <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Luong et al. use a Manhattan distance of z-scores for interval-scaled
attributes, and percentage of mismatching values for nominal attributes
to determine the distance between data-points. They determine that
discrimination has occurred if in its k-nearest neighbours those within
the same protected category have been treated differently to the
neighbours of a different category. They propose that on finding points
where they are confident that some discrimination has occurred, then the
class-label for that point should be amended. This data should then be
used to train subsequent models.</p>
<p>A seminal paper in the field, Dwork et al. <span id="id53">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id42">Dwork <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>]</span>
continued with the concept of a distance measure. They propose again
that individual fairness should be the goal. They suggest that given
some <em>task-specific</em> similarity metric, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta\)</span>, then
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\forall x, x' \in \mathcal{X}: \quad |f(x) - f(x')| \leq \delta (x, x')\)</span>
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)\)</span> produces a continuous score as opposed to a discrete label.
The authors acknowledge that obtaining <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta\)</span> is a tricky problem,
described as “one of the most challenging aspects of this framework”. It
may require input from social and legal scholars or domain experts to
help formulate this metric. This paper is particularly notable because
each of the authors have gone on to write about fairness extensively,
each gaining a reputation as an expert within their own right and covers
themes that have been spun into more fleshed out ideas. Examples of this
are Demographic Parity, the predominant fairness measure at the time,
being weak in some situations which has been explored in
<span id="id54">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id68">Hardt <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>]</span>, and noting that it there is a differentiation
between a data-provider (who obtains the data) and a vendor (who uses
the data to make decisions). It’s discussed that the vendor may not care
about fairness and this is explored further by two of the authors in
<span id="id55">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id115">Madras <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>]</span>. This is
discussed in section <a class="reference external" href="#impl_repr">4.3</a>{reference-type=”ref”

<p>As with all areas, the lines between the various points that fairness
constraints have been injected isn’t an easy thing to split. For
example, at what point does pre-processing the data become learning a
new representation for the data? As such, some of these methods blur
boundaries. However, in general, we can think of fairness interventions
occurring before, during, or after the training of the model as
suggested in <span id="id56">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id10">Barocas <em>et al.</em>, 2019</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>In this section we’ll look onto the broad categories <em>pre-processing</em> -
which includes feature selection and feature adjustment, <em>during
training</em> - which covers minimising fairness constraints directly,
adversarially removing sensitive attributes and learning fair
representations and <em>post-processing</em> - which hasn’t been well utilised,
but is still a valid point to insert fairness constraints.</p>
<div class="section" id="pre-processing">
<span id="impl-pre"></span><h3>Pre-processing<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This can form in two approaches. On one hand, the features can be
pre-processed, or the labels can be pre-processed. There is a general
trend to transforming the features to a new space, called learning a
fair representation of the data. This is covered under the ‘During
Training’ section. This section is reserved for those papers which
explicitly change the input features, such as “Certifying and Removing
Disparate Impact” <span id="id57">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id49">Feldman <em>et al.</em>, 2015</a>]</span>. This paper compares
the probability distributions of features across protected groups and
seeks to rectify this. Enforcing</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
P(\bar{x}|s=0) = P(\bar{x}|s=1)
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is a modified version of the original feature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this approach, each feature is ranked within sensitive sub-groups,
then shifted so as to retain the same rank whilst having an identical
distribution for each sub-group such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(s|\bar{x}) = 0.5\)</span>.</p>
<p>The concept of changing the input space is an intriguing one. On one
hand, a person’s features are not discriminatory in themselves, after
all, discriminatory features are <em>usually</em> qualitative. That said, some
features are due to the disparate impact of previous unfair decisions.
An example of this may be disproportionate wealth distribution in the US
manifesting itself as an unusually small number of white people
receiving public schooling
<span id="id58">[]</span>. Modifying this feature
to correct for previous biases may have merit. It may also be useful to
consider that amending the input space allows us to interpret what has
changed about an individual to make them appear less worthy of being
biased against, and to feed this back to policy makers. This is under a
reasonable assumption that the input space records some features that we
are able to interpret. For example, if we knew that an applicant were
more likely to pass the CV screening stage of a job application in a
decision agnostic to their gender by increasing the level of relevant
work experience, it may be that there should be a policy change to
encourage people into apprenticeships or internships. The other approach
is changing the labels, as discussed in section
<a class="reference external" href="#background">2</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”background”} about the
Kamiran and Calders paper <span id="id59">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id89">Kamiran and Calders, 2009</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>One of the more direct ways to enforce fairness is to follow Quadrianto
et al <span id="id60">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id132">Quadrianto and Sharmanska, 2017</a>]</span> who noticed that enforcing
fairness constraints is an application of Distribution Matching. They
use a modified SVM from the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI)
paradigm to ensure the sensitive feature is not used during test time,
but is available during training. They then pose a question about how
much fairness to apply. There is a fairness-utility trade-off and the
authors suggest a human should be responsible for selecting how much
fairness (within a legal limit) to apply. This concept of bringing
accountability into automated decision making is an important though
overlooked addition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adversarial-learning">
<span id="impl-adv"></span><h4>Adversarial Learning<a class="headerlink" href="#adversarial-learning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Given the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), there has
been an excitement to use this adversarial approach in other areas. In
the GAN framework, a generator produces some representation and a
discriminator determines between the generated representation and a
genuine sample. The area that has produced the greatest success to date
is modifying the GAN framework so that a regular model learns in the
presence of an adversary. We determine one of the hidden layers to be
our representation, from the input to this representation layer can be
thought of as the generator, and after the generator, the model splits
so that the rest of the regular network is the predictor. There is an
additional network, an adversary, that takes the hidden layer
representation as input and tries to predict the sensitive feature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span>.
The learning of the dual models takes place as a <em>min-max</em> game. On one
hand we have the generator trying to produce a representation which is
rich enough for the predictor to be accurate, so that our predictive
loss is minimised. On the other hand, the representation must be encoded
so that as little information about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> remains so that the adversary
cannot make an accurate prediction of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> from the representation
(maximising the loss of the adversary).</p>
<p>There are parallels between what we’re trying to achieve with fairness
constraints and the work that is being progressed in Domain adaptation.
One of the major breakthroughs in this work was adding a gradient
reversal layer <span id="id61">[]</span>. This has been
applied in many fields including Fairness. The gradient reversal layer
is applied to the adversary and allows the <em>min-max</em> game to become a
direct minimisation, as minimising the adversary now directly maximises
the adversary’s loss.</p>
<p>This framework was then used by Edwards and Storkey
<span id="id62">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id44">Edwards and Storkey, 2016</a>]</span> on making a representation that
censored a sensitive attribute. Beutel et al
<span id="id63">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id14">Beutel <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>]</span> then built on this and applied the
technique explicitly to fairness, demonstrating that this method is
particularly useful even with very small amounts of data. Other papers
have tried to build on this work, such as
<span id="id64">[]</span> who instead of using a
representation as the input to the adversary, use the soft output from
the predictor.</p>
<p>Other GAN approaches have followed the more traditional route of
generating data. Fairness is applied by making the generated data fair
to a specific attribute. “FairGAN” <span id="id65">[]</span> use a regular
GAN set-up, but have an additional discriminator to not just determine
if the data is real or not, but to also query whether the data generated
is fair<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id284" id="id66">6</a>. A second paper, “FairnessGAN” <span id="id67">[]</span> use a
similar approach, but instead of the UCI Adult dataset (which is
commonly used in nearly all fairness literature), they use use images
<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id285" id="id68">7</a> and achieve “generally positive” <span id="id69">[]</span> results.</p>

<span id="impl-repr"></span><h3>Fair Representations<a class="headerlink" href="#fair-representations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Work in this field was pioneered by Zemel
<span id="id70">[]</span> and was followed up by Madras
<span id="id71">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id115">Madras <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>]</span> who suggested that these could be
applied to transfer learning.</p>
<p>Zemel argues that fairness can be achieved through representation
learning. They suggest that the population in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> should be
transformed to a new space, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span> such that the mapping from
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span> satisfies demographic parity, but still
be as similar to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> as possible without retaining knowledge
of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> and that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span> should retain enough information
to maintain the same mapping from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{Z} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}\)</span>
as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}\)</span>. In this way, similar people
are treated similarly, a notion suggested by Dwork et al
<span id="id72">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id42">Dwork <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>]</span>. A surprising effect of this fair
representation is that it allows for transfer learning. Although
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span> was selected to retain the mapping to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{Y}\)</span> whilst
preserving as much information about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> as possible, they

<p>Madras et al. <span id="id73">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id115">Madras <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>]</span> explored this idea of
transfer learning further, but used the framework of Beutel et al
<span id="id74">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id14">Beutel <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>]</span>, which in turn is based on Edwards and
Storkey <span id="id75">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id44">Edwards and Storkey, 2016</a>]</span>, both discussed in the section
above. Madras demonstrate that fair representations can indeed be used
to predict other features and give a more robust set of experiments than
presented in the Zemel paper (which mentioned transfer learning as an
aside). They give motivation for this by defining two individuals. There
is a data collector who obtains the data and sells it, there is also a
vendor who purchases the data and uses it to create models. Madras
argues that the vendor may not care about fairness, and as such the
responsibility falls to the data collector to amend the data to a new,
fair representation. This provides a difficulty for the data collector
as they do not know what the vendor intends to do with the data. This is
the motivation for learning a fair, transferable representation.</p>

<span id="causal"></span><h2>Causal Inference<a class="headerlink" href="#causal-inference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the acknowledgement that fairness is difficult to solve
arithmetically, methods to incorporate subject matter expertise are
being explored. Causal models are appealing in this regard because they
allow for an explicit causal relationship to be accounted for rather
than relying on correlation.</p>
<p>DeDeo <span id="id77">[]</span> argues that without understanding the
causal relationship between attributes, then it becomes particularly
difficult to differentiate between innocent relationships, and those
which at first glance may appear innocent, but when you understand the
socio-economic background of those attributes, they might infer a less
innocent relationship.</p>
<p>Stemming from the work of Pearl <span id="id78">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id129">Pearl, 2009</a>]</span>, causal models
are an attempt to model cause and effect. An example would be
atmospheric pressure and the position of the needle on a barometer
reading. We know that the two are linked and our data about this will
demonstrate a high correlation between observations, but correlation
does not imply causation. Whist we know that changing the pressure will
effect the barometer, moving the needle on the barometer will not effect
the pressure in the room. The benefit of viewing the world in this way
is that we can transparently interpret why decisions have been made.
Obviously the relationships between features is complex, but we can
utilise experts from the domain we are trying to apply our model to.
This is a nice feature given that fairness itself is domain specific.
Whilst this may seem simple on the surface, it is highly complicated to
correctly model the world. For example, not all features are captured.
There may be an unobserved feature that confounds two features, so
whilst they may look as though they are connected in some way, they are
actually both reflective of the unseen confounder. An example of this is
height and level of education. On the surface we could draw a
correlation that the taller (on average) a population is, the higher the
level of education. This can be observed by visiting any primary or
secondary school, but we’re missing a confounder, age. What’s more,
there can be multiple confounders that affect different sets of
features. Whilst not insurmountable, this is nonetheless a very labour
intensive approach. In many ways, if this approach is fully realised, it
is the gold standard for ethical models.</p>
<p>A recent paper, “Path-Specific Counterfactual Fairness”
<span id="id79">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id26">Chiappa, 2019</a>]</span> poses some thought provoking
questions. They note that not all affects of a sensitive attribute on
the outcome are potentially discriminatory. They give the example of the
Berkley admissions data that was suggested to be discriminatory to
women. They note that women were applying with greater proportions to
classes with low acceptance rates, thus the influence of gender on the
class applied for is not discriminatory and should be taken into account
to learn a highly predictive model. This is similar to the idea first
mentioned in Pedreschi et al. <span id="id80">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id130">Pedreshi <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>]</span>
that there is a difference between sensitive attributes and potentially
discriminatory attributes. In <span id="id81">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id26">Chiappa, 2019</a>]</span> they
use the power of a causal model to isolate this to effects along
specific pathways noting “approaches based on statistical relations
among observations are in danger of not discerning correlation from
causation, and are unable to distinguish the different ways in which the
sensitive attribute might influence the decision”
<span id="id82">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id26">Chiappa, 2019</a>]</span>. This paper views unfairness as the
presence of an unfair causal effect of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{Y}\)</span>. This idea is
not new. In fact it is specifically mentioned in “Counterfactual
Fairness” <span id="id83">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id104">Kusner <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>]</span> that “a decision is unfair
toward an individual if it coincides with the one that would have been
taken in a counterfactual world in which the sensitive attribute were
different”. This assumes that the entire effect of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{Y}\)</span> is
problematic. The path-specific approach uses the same definition, but
modifies the ending to be “… counterfactual world in which the
sensitive attribute <em>along the unfair pathways</em> were different”. They
achieve this by measuring the effect of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> along unfair pathways and
disregarding it. In the simple case below</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="path-specific">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="content/09_appendix/publications/assets/path-specific.png"><img alt="content/09_appendix/publications/assets/path-specific.png" src="content/09_appendix/publications/assets/path-specific.png" style="height: 200px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>where the direct effect of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> is fair, but the effect of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> via
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> is unfair, then we can think of each variable being created of it’s
own characteristic <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta^{\text{variable}}\)</span>, plus the effect of its
parents <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta^{\text{variable}}_{\text{induced by}}\)</span>, plus noise
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon_{\text{variable}}\)</span>, so</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{align*}
S &amp;= \theta^s + \epsilon_s \\
M &amp;= \theta^m + \theta^m_s + \epsilon_m \\
Y &amp;= \theta^y + \theta^y_s + \theta^y_m + \epsilon_y
\end{align*}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>our goal would be to remove the effect of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> along unfair pathways,
giving</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{align*}
S &amp;= \theta^s + \epsilon_s \\
M_{\text{fair}} &amp;= \theta^m + \epsilon_m \\
Y_{\text{fair}} &amp;= \theta^y + \theta^y_s + \theta^y_{m_\text{fair}} + \epsilon_y
\end{align*}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In this case, (and in the case of “Counterfactual Fairness”
<span id="id84">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id104">Kusner <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>]</span>). The goal is to achieve fairness in
a counterfactual world as described above. This is a form of individual
fairness, and is often linked to the other seminal work in this area of
Dwork et al. <span id="id85">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib.html#id42">Dwork <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>]</span>. Whilst one uses a causal
model to determine the effect of group membership, the other uses a
distance measure. Clearly there are strengths and weaknesses to both
approaches.</p>

<p>The number of works involving fairness has exploded recently, but there
are still a number of avenues to be explored, particularly around
consolidating existing works. Whilst there are 3 broad categories of
fairness constraints, there are still relationships between fair
behaviour and positive discrimination to explore. However, fairness is
only one part of the ethical category. There is still plenty of work to
be done on explainability and accountability, and until these are also
addressed, discrimination can still lurk within an algorithm.</p>

<div class="section" id="discussion-conclusion">
<h2>Discussion / Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion-conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A concern with following any purely statistical route in knowing in
advance some attribute that you wish to be fair to. If we consider the
UCI Adult Dataset (a popular dataset for benchmarking fairness
algorithms with features such as Gender, Race and Nationality) and you
wish to be fair with regard to <em>religion</em>, a feature which is not been
captured in this dataset (though could be inferred using prior knowledge
and the nationality feature), you will not be able to claim fairness
with regard to that non-captured attribute, despite Freedom of
Religion<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id287" id="id93">9</a> being enshrined in most modern democratic countries. There
has been an attempt to address this problem in the paper Proxy
Fairness <span id="id94">[]</span> which finds potential proxy groups
that could potentially be discriminated against, though this is a first
foray into this particularly difficult problem.</p>
<p>Many classifiers are focused on making predictions without needing
sensitive attributes to be captured. Whilst this may help achieve
short-term goals, none of the methods discussed would be able to work if
that information were not captured in the first place. It may seem
counter-intuitive, but to ensure the long-term goals of ethical machine
learning, of fairer, more interpretable, more transparent and more
accountable algorithms, we need sensitive attributes to be recorded. We
may not use these features within our models, but if not captured, we
stand little chance of calming ethical concerns about the application of
our field to subjective areas.</p>
