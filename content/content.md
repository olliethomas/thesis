# Content

This site serves as an expended thesis/collection of works, and is structured in the following way.

First, the work in progress thesis, followed by annual review documents for reference, and lastly there is an appendix 
of works completed.

## Thesis

The structure of the thesis doesn't fall into a thesis by publication, but rather, a thesis supported by publication.
By that, I mean that I intend to have full thesis chapters that expand on published works.
The "story" that I am trying to tell is about identifying the parts of a decision making process that are influenced, 
rightly or not, by a sensitive attribute.

## Chapter 1
To identify these, we begin by trying to separate the "sensitive" part of a datapoint that have an effect on the decision
making process, from the parts of a datapoint that are not effected by a "sensitive" attribute.
This is achieved in [](09_appendix/publications/dfritdd.md), with a simple assumption of additive decomposition.
This is then extended in [](09_appendix/publications/nosinn.md) to allow for an arbitrarily complex reconstruction.

## Chapter 2
Given that some techniques have been presented that identify the parts of the data that are both sensitive and used to make a decision,
can we identify at deployment time, which individuals are most likely to have decisions influenced by a sensitive attribute.
And, in turn, can we use this to identify biased interpetation of features vs biased decisions.
This is acheieved in.
