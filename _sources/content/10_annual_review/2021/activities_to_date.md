### 2020-2021: Full Time
#### Submissions
- FAccT (September '20): We re-submitted the "Imagined Examples" paper with a new title, adding Dr. Miri Zilka as a co-author. 
  The direction of the paper shifted from providing additional traininig samples, to identifying at-risk individuals. 
  The title was changed to reflect this, becoming "Beyond Decision Dichotomy: When Two Fairness Axioms Collide in the Real World".
   - Outcome: Reject.
   - Scores and main criticism: 
     - Weak Accept "I do not see much discussion of the limitations of this approach".
     - Clear Accept "I liked the paper; I found it interesting".
     - Clear Reject "I found the paper somewhat confusingly written. I find the claimed innovations to be incremental, insufficiently developed, and below the acceptance bar".
     - Weak Accept "to make this a clear accept, it needs a bit more in terms of analyzing real data".

- AIES (January '21): Based on the above feedback, we added a discussion of the limitations and focussed heavily on the evaluation. 
  We also updated the title to "An Algorithmic Framework for Positive Action".
  - Outcome: Reject
  - Scores and main criticism:
    - Clear Reject "All in all, this reviewer is confused by the paper. It's filled with jargon and does not clearly explain to people from outside the field what is happening."
    - Weak Reject "They should explain more carefully key concepts".

- ICML Workshop on Socially Responsible AI (May '21): Based on the above, we re-worked the introduction to provide more 
  context and background. We added Dr. Adrian Weller as a co-author and streamlined the discussion section. 
  During the process of preparing the paper for submission to EAAMO '21, we decided to submit a much-reduced version of the paper 
  to test if our efforts to make the paper clearer.
  - Outcome: Reject
    - Scores and main criticism:
      - Reject "Although the authors clearly state their problem and their difference from the related works, the dataset used is very simple dataset that uses 6 features and 2 outcomes."
      - Borderline Reject "The experimental evaluation is weak."
      - Clear Accept "I think this work is interesting and would like to see it written as a full paper".
      - Borderline Reject "The counterfactual scenario considered in this work where the protected attribute is actually different is totally non-deterministic as the possibilities are infinite."

- EAAMO (May '21): At the same time as submitting to the above, we also submitted to EAAMO '21, the inaugural ACM 
  conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization with results on more datasets and a more developed background section.
  - Outcome expected August '21.

#### Additional In-Progress Works
- ReMixup
  - Mixup is a method for providing an interpolation of data. 
    This is a particularly useful tool when considering data with binary labels.
    In this work we have looked at using Mixup for learning a fair representation of data.
    We are investigating the use of Mixup to help both the performance of adversarial learning methods, and also in 
    quantifying the uncertainty of the model's representation.
